# Ecomonitor

Ecomonitor is a carbon finance + intellgience system developing intelligent financing  products for the voluntary carbon market.
We are developing a web3 protocol enabling carbon forwards, options, and streaming contracts as well as a data service to provide updates on the state of the ecological project.  We aim to work with nature-based carbon sequestration projects and organizations that seek to reduce carbon emission to enable issuance of environmental assets (future carbon credits, etc) for the voluntary carbon market.
